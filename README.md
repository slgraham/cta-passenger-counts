# cta-passenger-counts
Project to work with passenger boarding and alighting data from the Chicago Transit Authority

The CTA has an Automated Passenger Count system that keeps track of every time the bus opens it doors, recording passengers on, passengers off, and exact GPS location of the bus.  The goal of this project is to build some tools to analyze and visualize this data.

Data received from the CTA via FOIA is available here:
